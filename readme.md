# Calculating Determinant using Multiprogramming Techniques

This project aims at optimising the brute force algorithm for computing the determinant of a given matrix by using the concepts of multiprogramming. We have explored several techniques to solve this problem, learning about their advantages and disadvantages along the way. The goal is not to come up with the best or most efficient program to calculate the determinant of a matrix, but rather to understand and implement some core concepts which will prove to be useful in a vast variety of other similar problems.
